## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Booking Verification System

The system ensures only eligible users can review:

1. **User Authentication**: Must be logged in
2. **Booking Ownership**: Must own the booking
3. **Booking Status**: Must be `completed` or `checked_out`
4. **No Duplicate Reviews**: One review per booking (enforced by unique index)
5. **Correct Reference**: Booking must match the property/package

Example verification flow:

```javascript
const eligibility = await Review.canUserReview(userId, bookingId);
// Returns: { canReview: true/false, reason: "...", booking: {...} }
```

### ✅ Automatic Rating Updates

- Property/Package ratings update automatically when reviews are created
- Rating breakdown (1-5 stars) calculated and stored
- Average rating maintained in real-time

### ✅ Review Management

- Users can edit their reviews (with edit tracking)
- Users can delete their reviews (updates all related data)
- Admins can moderate reviews (change status)
- Admins can respond to reviews

### ✅ Helpful Tracking

- Users can mark reviews as helpful
- Prevents duplicate helpful marks from same user
- Shows helpful count for sorting/filtering

### ✅ Image Support

- Up to 5 images per review
- Stored in Cloudinary
- Includes alt text for accessibility

### ✅ Comprehensive Statistics

- Average rating calculation
- Rating breakdown (count per star level)
- Total review count
- Returned with every review list request

## API Response Examples

### Can Review Check

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "canReview": true,
    "booking": {
      "_id": "booking123",
      "bookingReference": "PKG-1234567890",
      "status": "completed"
    }
  }
}
```

### Create Review Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "_id": "review123",
    "title": "Amazing experience!",
    "content": "Had a wonderful time...",
    "rating": 5,
    "author": {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "avatar": "https://..."
    },
    "isVerified": true,
    "helpful": { "count": 0, "users": [] },
    "createdAt": "2025-10-06T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "message": "Review created successfully"
}
```

### Property Reviews with Stats

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "reviews": [...],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 10,
      "total": 45,
      "pages": 5
    },
    "ratingStats": {
      "averageRating": 4.5,
      "totalReviews": 45,
      "breakdown": {
        "5": 25,
        "4": 15,
        "3": 3,
        "2": 1,
        "1": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Frontend Integration Points

### 1. Booking Completion Flow

```
Booking Complete → Email with "Leave Review" CTA → Review Form
```

### 2. Property/Package Page

```
Show Reviews + Rating Stats
↓
User logged in?
  Yes → Check if they have completed bookings
    Has completed booking without review?
      Yes → Show "Write Review" button
      No → Show message: "Book and complete to review"
  No → Show "Login to review" message
```

### 3. User Dashboard/Booking History

```
For each completed booking:
  - If no review: "Leave Review" button
  - If has review: "View/Edit Review" button
```

## Security Measures

1. **Authorization Checks**: Users can only review their own bookings
2. **Status Validation**: Only completed bookings can be reviewed
3. **Unique Constraints**: Database-level prevention of duplicate reviews
4. **Input Validation**: Content length limits, rating range validation
5. **Image Limits**: Maximum 5 images per review
6. **XSS Protection**: Content is sanitized (via express middleware)
7. **Role-Based Access**: Admin endpoints protected by role middleware

## Database Relationships

```
User ──┐
       ├──> Booking ──┐
       │              ├──> Review ──> Property/Package
       └──────────────┘
```

- **User** creates **Booking**
- **Booking** (when completed) enables **Review**
- **Review** references **User**, **Booking**, and **Property/Package**

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes Created:

- Compound indexes for user-property and user-package combinations
- Single indexes for common query patterns
- Unique index on booking for data integrity

### Pagination:

- All list endpoints support pagination
- Default limit: 10 items per page
- Helps with large review datasets

### Populate Strategy:

- Only essential fields populated
- Avoids over-fetching data
- Improves response times

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests:

1. Review model methods (canUserReview, markAsHelpful, etc.)
